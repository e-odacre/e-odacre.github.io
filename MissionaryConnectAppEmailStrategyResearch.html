      <p>
        Missionary Connect is a platform designed to help missionaries stay connected with their churches and supporters. I researched and prepared to manage their <strong>5,000+ subscriber list in Mailchimp</strong>, focusing on strategies for promoting sales, webinars, and ongoing updates.
        <br>
        Although this project was primarily research and planning, it gave me experience adapting to a <strong>new ESP (Mailchimp)</strong> while preparing to meet the needs of a real organization.

      <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>Key takeaway</strong>: Every ESP has unique tools, but the fundamentals of segmentation, timing, and messaging remain the same. This project prepared me to confidently handle both small and large-scale email programs.
