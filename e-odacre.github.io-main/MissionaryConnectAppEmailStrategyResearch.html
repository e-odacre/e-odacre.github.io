    <!-- Overview -->

      <p>
        <strong>Missionary Connect</strong> is a platform that helps missionaries stay connected with their churches and supporters.  
        I researched and prepared strategies to manage their <strong>5,000+ subscriber list in Mailchimp</strong>, focusing on campaigns for sales, webinars, and ongoing updates.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3">
        While this project was primarily research and planning, it gave me hands-on experience adapting to a <strong>new ESP (Mailchimp)</strong> and preparing workflows for the needs of a real organization.

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>Audited the existing Mailchimp list of 5,000+ contacts.</li>
        <li>Planned <strong>weekly newsletters</strong> to maintain supporter engagement.</li>
        <li>Outlined a strategy for <strong>sales campaigns and webinar promotions</strong>.</li>
        <li>Explored Mailchimp’s segmentation and automation tools for relevance and timing.</li>
        <li>Prepared workflows to align with organizational goals and stakeholder needs.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li>Gained familiarity with <strong>Mailchimp workflows</strong> and how they compare to Klaviyo.</li>
        <li>Learned to approach <strong>list management at scale (5,000+ subscribers)</strong>.</li>
        <li>Adapted my <strong>MJML design knowledge</strong> to a new platform.</li>
        <li>Built confidence in supporting <strong>real-world client communication needs</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Every ESP has unique tools, but the fundamentals of segmentation, timing, and messaging remain the same.  
        This project prepared me to confidently handle both small and large-scale email programs.
